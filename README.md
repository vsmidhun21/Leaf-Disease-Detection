# Leaf-Disease-Detection
In our Leaf Disease Detection project, we leverage a powerful combination of OpenCV, TensorFlow, Keras, and SciPy to develop an intelligent and robust system. OpenCV facilitates image processing and manipulation, enabling us to extract meaningful features from leaf images. TensorFlow and Keras are employed for the implementation of deep learning models, allowing us to train and deploy neural networks that excel at recognizing patterns associated with various leaf diseases. Additionally, SciPy is utilized for scientific computing tasks, enhancing the overall efficiency and accuracy of our disease detection algorithms. This integration of cutting-edge technologies ensures a comprehensive solution for early detection and classification of plant diseases, empowering farmers with timely insights to protect their crops.
